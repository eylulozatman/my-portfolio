The donations made are stored in the database and the Blood Request Service receives each new request with a scheduler function that listens every 3 minutes. If there is blood in the blood bank that meets the appropriate criteria, a message is returned indicating that the request sent to the hospital has been fulfilled. Flask was used as technology in this project.',
